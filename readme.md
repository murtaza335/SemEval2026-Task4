# Comprehensive EDA for SemEval Narrative Similarity

This repository contains the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** performed for the **SemEval Narrative Similarity** project.  
The goal of this EDA is to understand the structure, distribution, and characteristics of the dataset—particularly the *anchor*, *text_a*, and *text_b* fields—and to visualize patterns that may support modeling decisions later.
